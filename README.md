## Overview

Do you struggle with some of life's deepest questions? Ask Oracle.
Oracle is a simple application that interacts with GPT-3, an AI model crafted by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/). By entering your burning questions, you are conversing with a simulation of a wise Oracle. Responses from Oracle hint at inspirational and mysterious, with just a touch of existentialism.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project was to showcase my front-end development skills and highlight my love of design for Shopify's Front End Developer Intern Challenge.

## Technical Requirements

- [x] Simple-to-use interface
- [x] A form for entering text prompts
- [x] Submitting the form sends the prompt to the OpenAI API
- [x] Results displayed in a list, sorted from newest to oldest
- [x] Each result includes the original prompt and a response from the API
- [x] The HTML that ends up being served client-side should be accessible and semantic

##### Extras:

- [x] Nicer design
- [x] Make the app more specific to a single purpose
