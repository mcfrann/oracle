## Overview

Struggle with life's deepest questions. Ask Oracle.
Oracle is a simple application that reacts with GPT-3, an AI model crafted by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/). By entering your burning questions, you interact with a formatted simulation of a wise Oracle. Responses from Oracle hint at inspiration and mystery with just a touch of existentialism.

## Technical Requirements

- [x] Simple-to-use interface
- [x] A form for entering text prompts
- [x] Submitting the form sends the prompt to the OpenAI API
- [x] Results are displayed in a list, sorted from newest to oldest. Each result should include the original prompt and a response from the API.
- [x] The HTML that ends up being served client-side should be accessible and semantic

##### Extras:

- [x] Nicer design
- [x] Make the app more specific to a single purpose.

## Technologies and Tools

- React
- HTML
